# Titanic--ML-from-Disaster
Titanic-dataset Analysis
Used ML models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic-shipwreck.

We started with the data exploration where we got a feeling for the dataset, checked about missing data and learned which features are important. During this process we used seaborn and matplotlib to do the visualizations. During the data preprocessing part, we computed missing values, converted features into numeric ones, grouped values into categories and created a few new features. Afterwards we started training 4 different machine learning models, picked one of them (random forest) and compute the model's precision.
